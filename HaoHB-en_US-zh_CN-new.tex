By understanding AMD GPU microarchitecture to achieve performance tuning bare metal.
After a quick investigation of AMD GCN3 ISA architecture and LLVM assembly tools, I came to the conclusion that it is possible to build optimized assembly kernels for GCN.
%Based on AMD CPU \& GPU heterogeneous programming platform ROCm, I read and analyze rocBLAS and MIOpen source code. Test MIOpen and cuDNN, Caffe (native) performance comparison. Optimize MIOpen, add fp16 implementation for MIOpen (in progress).
\begin{itemize}
  %\item  Developed distributed algorithms(CART/GBDT/GBRT/RF) on Spark.

%The goal of this task is to detect and correct spelling errors on Chinese essays.
CATMAID (Collaborative Annotation Toolkit for Massive Amounts of Image Data) is an efficient web collaboration annotation tool. I redevelop CATMAID (40k+ python, 230k+ js) so that it can be used to annotate 5d-images.%The requirements of the 5d (x, y, z, c, t) image are met by modifying the CATMAID (3d-x, y, z) source (40k+ python, 230k+ js code).
\begin{itemize}
  %\item Handled this task with a unified framework which consisted of candidate generating, two stage candidates re-ranking and global decision making.
  %\item Identify and modify the bugs of the CATMAID source code to resolve the bug that CATMAID migrated from the django low version to the high version.
  \item I fixed many bugs when I migrate CATMAID from the django lower version to high version.
  %\item Finished candidate generating model and two stage candidates re-ranking model. Optimized F1-score 18\%.
  \item On the basis of HHMI Janelia Research open source project CATMAID , I implement the feature that multi-people can do annotation simultaneously.
